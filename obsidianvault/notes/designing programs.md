**high level steps**
1. define goal
	- ex. "Generate randomized dungeons that will produce interesting looking caverns"
2. define requirements
	- list solution constraints and the functional capabilities of the program
3. define tools, targets, and backup plan
	- define what program will run on
	- determine what technologies used
	- determining testing/feedback/release strategy]
	- determining code backup
4. break down problem
	- break down tasks into multiple, individual subtasks
5. figure out sequence of events
	- link tasks together and order them

**implementation steps**
1. outline main function
	-  ex.
```
//calculator
int main() {
	//get user input for first number
	//get math operation
	//get user input for second number
	//calculate result
	//print result
}
```
2. implement each function
	1. define the function prototype (inputs and outputs)
	2. write the function
	3. test the function
3. test the program and fix

**other advice**
- keep programs simple to start
- add features over time
- focus on one area at a time
- test each piece of code
- don't need to have perfect early code
- optimize for maintainability, not performance




**general program overview**
	to "import" another file's functions into the main file, just prototype it at the top or include a header file that has the prototypes
